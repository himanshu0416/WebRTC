WebRtc
- 4 sequential steps
	- Signaling: collects information about media type. Uses part of SDP(Session Description protocol).
	- Connecting: make ice connection
	- Securing: Secure the connection made with tls
	- Communicating: communicate using RTP
	
Signaling
	- Signaling is the initial step of creating a call.
	- When you create a WebRTC agent it is empty without any endpoints information.
	- Signaling messages are basically keyvalue pair of text like we have in properties files.The key should always be letters, due to boundation of SDP.
 
		Session Description Protocol
			- A Session Description then contains an unlimited amount of Media Descriptions.
			- A Media Description usually maps to a single stream of media. So if you wanted to describe a call with three video streams and two audio tracks you would have five Media Descriptions.
			- uses key value pair as follows 
				a=my-sdp-value
				a=second-value
			- a media description key always followed by the attributes for that media descriptor
			- Not all key values defined by the Session Description Protocol are used by WebRTC. The following are the only keys you need to understand.
				    v - Version, should be equal to ‘0’
					o - Origin, contains a unique ID useful for renegotiations
					s - Session Name, should be equal to ‘-’
					t - Timing, should be equal to ‘0 0’
					m - Media Description, described in detail below
					a - Attribute, free text field this is the most common line in WebRTC
					c - Connection Data, should be equal to ‘IN IP4 0.0.0.0’

		Session Description Protocol and WebRTC 
			- Offers and Answers: One agent offerer the other agent is answerer. the answerer can reject connection offers based on the media descriptions or codecs.
			- Transceivers: Transceivers is a WebRTC specific concept that you will see in the API. Each Media Description becomes a Transceiver. Every time you create a Transceiver a new Media Description is added to the local Session Description.

Connecting
	- peer to peer connection
	- Need of Dedicated connecting subsystem
		-difference in network locations, different connecting factors like accepting connections on different ports or following different protocols like UDP and TCP.
		- pros of using webRTC over traditional connection approaches
			- Reduced Bandwidth Costs for media communication: due to peer-to-peer connection
			- Lower Latency : since no server is involved, the communication is between peers directly.
			- Secure E2E Communication : MITM is a difficult since there is no one in between two peers.
		- How does it work?
			- It uses ICE protocol. It overcomes the real world networking constraints
			- ICE is a protocol that tries to find the best way to communicate between two ICE Agents. Each ICE Agent publishes the ways it is reachable, these are known as candidates. ICE then determines the best pairing of candidates.
			- Pros of using ICE
				- takes care of agents in different networks
				- there are not protocol restrictions
				- It also handles the firewall/IDS rules
				- WebRTC uses NAT(Network Address translation) Mapping: 
					- When you send a packet to an address outside your network, a mapping is created! A NAT Mapping is just a temporary public IP/Port that is allocated by your NAT.
					- The outbound message will be rewritten to have its source address be the newly created mapping. If a message isn’t sent, it will be automatically routed back to the host inside the NAT.
					
					There are three behaviours on which nat mapping could be created
						- Endpoint-Independent Mapping: 1 mapping per sender in NAT. Same NAT map is used for all the communication.
						- Address Dependent Mapping: New mapping for each new remote/destination address(ONLY IP Address not PORT)
						- Address and Port Dependent Mapping: New mapping for each new remote/destination address(Includes PORT)
					There are three behaviours on which nat mapping filters: 
						- Endpoint-Independent Filtering: Open for public. Anyone can use that NAT mapping.
						- Address Dependent Filtering: Only the host(IP Address) created the mapping can use it for communication.
						- Address and Port Dependent Filtering: Only the host and port for which the mapping was created for can use that mapping.
					Another concept of Mapping refresh, which states to remove the unused mapping after 5 minutes.
				- STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT) used by ICE/TURN
					- It is useful because it allows the programmatic creation of NAT Mappings.
					- It creates and returns the mapping details for sharing it with others.

						- STUN Message Type : Binding Request - 0x0001 or Binding Response - 0x0101
							- To create a NAT Mapping we make a Binding Request. Then the server responds with a Binding Response.
						- Message Length: This is how long the Data section is
						- Magic Cookie: The fixed value 0x2112A442 in network byte order, it helps distinguish STUN traffic from other protocols.
						- Transaction ID: A 96-bit identifier that uniquely identifies a request/response. This helps you pair up your requests and responses
						- Data: Data will contain a list of STUN attributes.

							- STUN binding requests contains header only
							- The STUN Binding Response uses a XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS (0x0020). This attribute contains an IP/Port. This is the IP/Port of the NAT Mapping that is created!
							
						- Create a NAT Mapping
							- Send binding request to STUN SV
							- receives the binidng response containg the NAT mapping. this NAT mapping is your Public IP or Server Reflexive Candidate.
						- Determining NAT Type
							- STUN defines a method for running a test to determine your NAT Type. This would be useful because you would know ahead of time if direct connectivity was possible.
							
							
				- TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) used when direct connectivity isn't possible due to difference in protocols or NAT types are incompatible.
					- By running all your communication through TURN you obscure the client’s actual address.
					- TURN uses a dedicated server.
					- The client connects to a TURN Server and creates an Allocation.
					- By creating an Allocation a client gets a temporary IP/Port/Protocol that can send into to get traffic back to the client.This new listener is known as the Relayed Transport Address.
					- For each peer you give the Relay Transport Address to, you must create a Permission to allow communication with you.
					- When you send outbound traffic via TURN it is sent via the Relayed Transport Address. When a remote peer gets traffic they see it coming from the TURN Server.
					
					- TURN Lifecycle
						- Allocations: Allocations are at the core of TURN. An allocation is basically a ‘TURN Session’. To create a TURN allocation you communicate with the TURN Server Transport Address.
							- Requirements: 
								- Username/Password - Creating TURN allocations require authentication
								- Allocation Transport/Protocol - The Relayed Transport Address can be UDP or TCP
								- Even-Port - You can request sequential ports for multiple allocations
							- Response from TURN Server
								- XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS - Mapped Address of the TURN Client. recieve3s data from TURN server
								- RELAYED-ADDRESS - This is the address that you give out to other clients. If someone sends a packet to this address it is relayed to the TURN client.
								- LIFETIME - How long until this TURN Allocation is destroyed. You can extend the lifetime by sending a Refresh request.
						- Permissions
							- A remote host can’t send into your Relayed Transport Address until you create a permission for them.
							- The remote host needs to give you the IP/Port as it appears to the TURN server. This means it should send a STUN Binding Request to the TURN Server.
							
						- SendIndication/ChannelData
							- These two messages are for the TURN Client to send messages to a remote peer.
							- SendIndication is a self-contained message. Inside it is the data you wish to send, and who you wish to send it too.
							- ChannelData allows you to send data, but not repeat an IP Address. You create a Channel with an IP/Port. You then send with the ChannelId, and the IP/Port is populated server side.
						- Refreshing
							- Allocations will destroy themselves automatically. 
							- The TURN Client must refresh them sooner than the LIFETIME given when creating the allocation.

				- ICE(Interactive Connectivity Establishment)
					-  ICE is a protocol for establishing connectivity. 
					- It determines all the possible routes between the two peers and then ensures you stay connected.
					- These routes are known as Candidate Pairs, which is a pairing of a local and remote address. 
					- These addresses can be your local IP Address, NAT Mapping, or Relayed Transport Address, generated by your STUN or TURN server
					- Two ICE Agents communicate using the STUN Protocol.
					- They send STUN packets to each other to establish connectivity. 
					- After connectivity is established they can send whatever they want. 
					
					- Creating an ICE Agent
						- ICE agent can be defined as either controlling or controlled. 
						- Peer sending offer is controlling and decides the selected Candidate Pair.
						- Both sides exchange the user fragment and password. extracted from the Session description during the signaling.
						- user fragment sent in plain text and password is used to generate a MESSAGE-INTEGRITY attribute.
						- At the end of each STUN packet, there is an attribute used to authenticate the packet, that is a hash of the entire packet using the password as a key.
					
					- Candidate Gathering
						- gather all the possible addresses we are reachable at. These addresses are known as candidates.
					- Important keywords
						- Host : A Host candidate is listening directly on a local interface. This can either be UDP or TCP.
						- mDNS: A mDNS candidate is similar to a host candidate, Instead of informing the other side about your IP address, you give them a UUID. You then set-up a multicast listener, and respond if anyone requests the UUID you published.
							- use multicast withing same network
						
						- Server Reflexive: STUN Binding Response, the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS is your Server Reflexive Candidate.
						- Peer Reflexive: Recieving a inbound request from remote peer not known to you.
							-This commonly happens when a Host Candidate communicates with a Server Reflexive Candidate. A new NAT Mapping was created because you are communicating outside your subnet.
						- Relay: Turn server gives you relay address after inital handshake.
					- Connectivity Checks
						- We can now attempt to connect! Every candidate is paired with each other. So if you have 3 candidates on each side, you now have 9 candidate pairs.
						- Check image here https://webrtcforthecurious.com/docs/03-connecting/#connectivity-checks
					- Candidate Selection:
						- The Controlling and Controlled Agent both start sending traffic on each pair. This is needed if one Agent is behind a Address Dependent Mapping, this will cause a Peer Reflexive Candidate to be created.
						- Each Candidate Pair that saw network traffic is then promoted to a Valid Candidate pair. 
						- The Controlling Agent then takes one Valid Candidate pair and nominates it. This becomes the Nominated Pair. 
						- The Controlling and Controlled Agent then attempt one more round of bi-directional communication. If that succeeds, the Nominated Pair becomes the Selected Candidate Pair
					- Restarts
						- If the Selected Candidate Pair stops working for any reason (NAT Mapping Expires, TURN Server crashes) the ICE Agent will go to Failed state. Both agents can be restarted and do the whole process over again.
